  "notes": "Sticks are used in nearly every tool, weapon, and many other recipes (torches, ladders, signs, fences, rails, etc.). 2 planks placed vertically yield 4 sticks. 2 bamboo placed vertically yield 1 stick. Planks are the better source: 1 log -> 4 planks -> 8 sticks. Can be crafted in the 2x2 player crafting grid — no crafting table needed. Sticks can also be obtained from: dead bushes (0-2 sticks), leaf blocks (rare drop), fishing (as junk), witch drops, and bonus chest loot.",
