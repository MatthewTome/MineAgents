  "notes": "The furnace smelts ores into ingots, cooks food, and converts materials (sand->glass, logs->charcoal, clay->bricks, etc.). Fuel options: coal/charcoal (8 items each), planks (1.5 items), logs (1.5 items), sticks (0.5 items), lava_bucket (100 items — best fuel), blaze_rod (12 items), dried_kelp_block (20 items). IMPORTANT: Only cobblestone, blackstone, or cobbled_deepslate can be used to craft a furnace — andesite, diorite, granite, and other stone variants do NOT work. Requires a crafting table. Place the furnace to use it — put fuel in the bottom slot and items to smelt in the top slot.",
