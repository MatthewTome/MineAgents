  "notes": "The Block of Bamboo acts as a log equivalent but yields only 2 planks (instead of the 4 planks that normal logs yield). This means bamboo is half as efficient as regular logs for plank production. 9 bamboo -> 1 Block of Bamboo -> 2 bamboo planks. For comparison: 1 oak log -> 4 oak planks. To substitute all 6 logs needed for Iron Tools Pipeline with bamboo, you would need 12 Blocks of Bamboo = 108 bamboo total. Block of Bamboo can also be used as furnace fuel (smelts 1.5 items, same as a log). Requires a crafting table.",
