  "notes": "Iron ingots are one of the most important resources in Minecraft. They are used for tools, armor, shields, buckets, shears, anvils, and more. The Iron Tools Pipeline requires 41 iron ingots total (for all tools, armor, shield, bucket, and shears). The most common method is mining iron ore and smelting it, but there are MANY other ways to obtain iron ingots. Do NOT just look for 'iron_ingot' items on the ground — that is very unlikely. Instead, look for iron ORE to mine and smelt, or use one of the other methods below.",

Mine with a STONE PICKAXE or better — wooden pickaxes CANNOT mine iron ore. In Minecraft 1.17+, mining iron ore drops 'raw_iron' (not the ore block itself unless using Silk Touch). Smelt 1 raw_iron in a furnace with any fuel to get 1 iron_ingot. Coal/charcoal smelts 8 items each. A lava bucket smelts 100 items.",
