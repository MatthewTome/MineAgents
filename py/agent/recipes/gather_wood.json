  "notes": "Wood (logs) is the most fundamental resource in Minecraft. Everything starts with punching a tree. Logs are converted into planks (1 log = 4 planks), which are used for sticks, crafting tables, tools, building, and fuel. You do NOT need any tools to chop wood — punching trees works (just slower). An axe speeds up wood chopping significantly. All log types are functionally interchangeable for planks and fuel. The Iron Tools Pipeline needs at minimum 6 logs (24 planks). Building a shelter requires ~50 logs.",

      "details": "Look for tree trunks in your perception snapshot (oak_log, spruce_log, birch_log, jungle_log, acacia_log, dark_oak_log, mangrove_log, cherry_log, pale_oak_log). Walk to a tree and break the trunk blocks. No tools needed — you can punch wood. An axe (any tier) speeds this up dramatically. Each trunk block drops 1 log. Trees are typically 4-7 blocks tall (jungle trees can be 30+ blocks). After chopping the trunk, leaves decay naturally and may drop saplings and sticks. Common tree types by biome: oak (plains, forest), spruce (taiga, mountains), birch (birch forest), jungle (jungle), acacia (savanna), dark oak (dark forest).",
