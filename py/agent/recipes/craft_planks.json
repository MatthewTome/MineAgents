Planks can be crafted in the 2x2 player crafting grid — no crafting table needed. ALL the following block types produce planks: oak_log, spruce_log, birch_log, jungle_log, acacia_log, dark_oak_log, mangrove_log, cherry_log, pale_oak_log (yields respective plank type), crimson_stem and warped_stem (yields crimson/warped planks — Nether wood types that don't burn), stripped versions of all logs/stems also work, wood blocks (oak_wood, spruce_wood, etc.) also work, and block_of_bamboo yields bamboo_planks.",
