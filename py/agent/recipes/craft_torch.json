  "notes": "Torches provide light level 14, preventing hostile mob spawning in a radius around them. Essential for mining and shelter safety. Each craft yields 4 torches. Coal is mined from coal ore with any pickaxe. Charcoal is made by smelting logs in a furnace. Can be crafted in the 2x2 player crafting grid — no crafting table needed. Torches can be placed on walls and floors. Soul torches (using soul sand/soul soil instead of coal) provide dimmer light (10) but repel piglins.",
